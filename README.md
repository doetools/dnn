# Deep Neural Network from Scratch

We are going to build a multi-layer-percepton (MLP) model from scratch using C++ and CUDA. Some key modules include basic percepton, layers, forward propogation, backward proporgation (to find the partial derivative), and more. The process of training a MLP and inference once fully traned is heavily dependent on matrix multiplication, which can be parallelized to run on GPU to speed up the process. After finishing the core of the model, we will wrap it with a web application using GO and visualize the MLP as well as its training and inference online.
